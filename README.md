# Django Gen YAML Descriptor

The Django Gen YAML Descriptor is a web-based editor designed to help you quickly and easily define your Django project's backend structure using a YAML schema. This YAML file can then be used with the `django-gen` Python package to automatically generate your Django applications, models, fields, and API configurations, accelerating your API development.

## Features

- **YAML Schema Definition:** Visually define your Django backend, including:

  - **Apps:** Root elements containing lists of Django applications.
  - **Models:** Within each app, define your models with their respective fields and options.
  - **Fields:** Specify field names, types, and Django-specific options for your models.
  - **API:** Configure API endpoints, serializers, and permissions for each model.

- **Real-time Validation and Autocompletion:**

  - **Real-time Validation:** As you type, the editor provides instant checks for errors and warnings, ensuring your YAML is correctly formatted and adheres to Django conventions.
  - **Autocompletion:** Press `Ctrl+Space` for context-aware suggestions, speeding up your YAML creation.
  - **Hover Information:** Hover over keywords for detailed documentation and explanations.

- **File Operations:**

  - **Save:** Download your generated YAML schema as a `.yaml` file to your local machine.
  - **Load:** Upload an existing `.yaml` file from your computer into the editor for further modification.

- **Template Library:**

  - Explore and apply pre-defined YAML schemas for common Django project types.
  - Clicking on a template (e.g., E-commerce Platform, Blog Platform) populates the editor with its corresponding schema, providing a great starting point for your projects.

- **Customizable Editor Settings:**

  - **Editor Theme:** Choose between different themes (e.g., Dark) for a personalized editing experience.
  - **Font Size:** Adjust the font size of the editor to your preference.
  - **Word Wrap:** Toggle word wrapping for better readability of long lines.
  - **Minimap:** Enable or disable the minimap for a high-level overview of your YAML structure.

- **Strict Validation (Optional):**
  - Enforce all schema rules to ensure strict adherence to Django conventions. While disabling this may allow for more flexible configurations, it could lead to runtime errors when generating your project with `django-gen`.

## How it Works

The Django Gen YAML Descriptor acts as a user-friendly interface for creating the YAML input required by the `django-gen` package. Once you've defined your project structure in the editor and saved the YAML file, you can then use `django-gen` to transform that YAML into a fully functional Django project.

This project streamlines the initial setup and boilerplate code generation for Django APIs, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and less on repetitive configuration tasks.

## Getting Started

1.  **Access the Django Gen YAML Descriptor:** [Link to your deployed application or instructions on how to run it locally].
2.  **Define your Project:**
    - Start from scratch by typing your YAML directly into the editor.
    - Load an existing YAML file.
    - Choose a template from the "Templates" tab to pre-populate the editor with a common project structure.
3.  **Utilize Validation and Autocompletion:** Pay attention to the real-time feedback from the editor to ensure your YAML is correct.
4.  **Save Your YAML:** Click the "Save" button to download your `schema-definition.yaml` file.
5.  **Generate Your Django Project:** Use the `django-gen` Python package with your saved YAML file. Refer to the `django-gen` documentation for detailed instructions on how to use the package.

## About `django-gen`

The `django-gen` Python package is the companion tool to this descriptor. It takes the YAML schema generated by this editor and programmatically creates Django applications, models, serializers, views, URLs, and other necessary components, significantly speeding up the development of Django REST APIs.

For more information on `django-gen`, please refer to its official documentation: [Django Gen](https://github.com/joegsuero/django-generator).
